## Docker_exploration

1. Going through some docker lessons. 

### Docker commands:


> Seeing the running docker containers: ```docker ps```
> Running a Dcoker container named <docker/getting-started> mapped to port 80 on the local host in detach mode <-d>: ```docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started```
> Forcing the deletion of a Docker image: ```docker rm -f <imgID>```


The cmd above enables you to access docker documetnation by running a web server on your localhost.

> Docker_Exploration Directory added/created for docker exercises.
