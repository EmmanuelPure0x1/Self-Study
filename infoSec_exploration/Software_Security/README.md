## Software Security

In this repository, I will be exploring the aspects of software that either make it securr or unsecure. 

I will first explore common protocols that software use to make interconnected communications possible. 

Protocol will include: 

- DNS
- ICMP
- HTTP/HTTPS
- SMB
- FTP

And more..
