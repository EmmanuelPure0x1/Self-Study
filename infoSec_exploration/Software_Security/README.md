## Software Security

In this repository, I will be exploring the aspects of software that either make it securr or unsecure. 

I will first explore common protocols that software use to make interconnected communications possible. 

Protocols will include: 

- DNS
- ICMP
- HTTP/HTTPS
- SMTP
- FTP
- TCP/IP 
- SNMP
- ARP

And more..
